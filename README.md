This repository contains the source code of the Stock Count app by Socket Mobile for iOS. The Stock Count app is published in [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stock-count-by-socket-mobile/id1351421444?ls=1&mt=8). 

Stock Count is a utility app to help Socket Mobile customers leverage Socket Mobile barcode scanners' high speed scanning capability for routine stock/inventory counting jobs. It allows user to quickly scan multiple SKUs in "rapid fire" fashion, using Socket Mobile barcode scanners or contactless RFID readers. The scanned data will be written into a editable text file, with quantity information automatically added to each scan. User will be able to share the file (.txt format) and import it into most inventory management systems. 


### System information ###

* Requires iOS 11.0 or later version
* Supports iPhone and iPod Touch (6th generation)
* App version 1.0


### How to use the app ###

The app is designed to work with or without a Socket Mobile device. If you don't have a Socket Mobile device connected, you can still use the built-in camera of the device to scan the barcode. However, to take the advantage of the "rapid fire" capability, you will need a Socket Mobile device to be connected to your iPhone or iPod Touch in Application Mode. 

To do so, we recommend using Socket Mobile Companion app, which can be downloaded from [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/socket-mobile-companion/id1175638950).  

To start using the app, simply create a new file and start scanning the items you set up to count. By default, the app will automatically add a quantity of 1 after each scan. You can change the quantity in the text file or the default quantity in the Scan Settings. 


### License and agreement ###

The app integrates Socket Mobile Capture SDK and is free for adaptation per your own business needs under Socket Mobile license and user agreements. You will need to join Socket Mobile Developer program to access the SDK and create AppKey for your own application. The Socket Mobile Developer program is free for life with a one time registration fee.
